Unit Tests for Logger Handlers

This module contains unit tests for the logger handler configuration utilities
provided by the `attach_file_handler` and `attach_stream_handler` functions.
These tests ensure that handlers are correctly added to loggers and that log
messages are properly written to files or streams.

Test Functions:
    - test_configure_file_handler: Tests adding a file handler to a logger.
    - test_configure_stream_handler: Tests adding a stream handler to a logger.

Dependencies:
    - pytest: For running the test cases.
    - logging: For verifying logger behavior.
    - sys: For stream handling.
    - atria_logger.utilities: Provides the `attach_file_handler` and `attach_stream_handler` functions.
